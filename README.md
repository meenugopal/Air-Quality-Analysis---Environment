## Air-Quality-Analysis---Domain : Environment
This project is part of my UPX Data Analystics and AI where I used various ML algorithms to predict the model and used RMSE is the measure to minimize the prediction error
Air Quality Analysis and Prediction using ML algorithms
The objective is to predict the Relative Humidity at a given point of time based on all other attributes affecting the change in RH.
